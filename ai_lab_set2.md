# AI Navigator Lab Set 2

## No Code AI Labs

**Lab 1: Data Cleaning**  
*Goal:* Practice hands-on data cleaning; LLM can explain and generate the code  

**Prompt:**  
"Here is a messy dataset (mock a messy csv if one is not provided). Write Python code and provide no-code ways to: Remove rows with missing data, Normalize numerical columns, One-hot encode categorical features"


---

**Lab 2: Data Exploration**  
*Goal:* Get familiar with data exploration using LLM  

**Prompt:**  
"I have a dataset with the following columns: [Insert column names here, e.g., Date, Product, Sales, Region, Customer Type] Here are a few sample rows: [Insert 3–5 representative rows of data or a table preview] Please help me answer the following questions:  
1. What insights can you extract from this dataset?  
2. What trends or patterns do you notice over time or across categories?  
3. Are there any outliers or anomalies worth noting?  
4. What are the top-performing and underperforming categories or regions?  
5. What charts or visualizations would best present these insights?  
6. Can you generate a summary report in plain English with bullet points or section headings?"


---

**Lab 3: Fairness Check**  
*Goal:* Practice applying fairness principles in a simulated audit with AI help  

**Prompt:**  
"Act as a fairness auditor. Analyze this dataset metadata (you can mock a CSV) and suggest how to ensure diversity and fairness across gender and age."


---

**Lab 4: Prompt Refinement**  
*Goal:* Practice prompt engineering; compare how input quality changes LLM response quality  

**Prompt:**  
"Rewrite the following vague prompt to make it specific, contextual, and goal-oriented: ‘Help me with my report.’"


---

**Lab 5: Fine-Tuning Practice**  
*Goal:* Get familiar with data format and tone alignment for fine-tuning LLMs  

**Prompt:**  
"Create a sample JSONL file with 5 training examples to fine-tune an LLM for customer support tone. Explain in simple terms LLM fine-tuning, and generate python code with explanation to perform fine tuning with OpenAI. Also show how to use the fine tuned model in real-applications. Format: {‘prompt’: ‘...’, ‘completion’: ‘...’}"
